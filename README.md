1.0 INTRODUCTION.

A brief summary of the product being tested. Outline all the functions at a high level.

2.0 OBJECTIVES AND TASKS.

2.1 Objectives

Describe the objectives supported by the Master Test Plan, eg., defining tasks and
responsibilities, vehicle for communication, document to be used as a service level
agreement, etc.

2.2 Tasks
List all tasks identified by this Test Plan, i.e., testing, post-testing, problem reporting, etc.

3.0 SCOPE

General

This section describes what is being tested, such as all the functions of a specific product,
its existing interfaces, integration of all functions.
Tactics
List here how you will accomplish the items that you have listed in the "Scope" section.
For example, if you have mentioned that you will be testing the existing interfaces, what
would be the procedures you would follow to notify the key people to represent their
respective areas, as well as allotting time in their schedule for assisting you in
accomplishing your activity?

4.0 TESTING STRATEGY

Describe the overall approach to testing. For each major group of features or feature
combinations, specify the approach which will ensure that these feature groups are 
adequately tested. Specify the major activities, techniques, and tools which are used to
test the designated groups of features.
The approach should be described in sufficient detail to permit identification of the major
testing tasks and estimation of the time required to do each one.

4.1 Unit Testing

Definition:
Specify the minimum degree of comprehensiveness desired. Identify the techniques
which will be used to judge the comprehensiveness of the testing effort (for example,
determining which statements have been executed at least once). Specify any additional
completion criteria (for example, error frequency). The techniques to be used to trace
requirements should be specified.
Participants:
List the names of individuals/departments who would be responsible for Unit Testing.
Methodology:
Describe how unit testing will be conducted. Who will write the test scripts for the unit
testing, what would be the sequence of events of Unit Testing and how will the testing
activity take place?
4.2 System and Integration Testing.

Definition:
List what is your understanding of System and Integration Testing for your project.
Participants:
Who will be conducting System and Integration Testing on your project? List the
individuals that will be responsible for this activity.
Methodology:
Describe how System & Integration testing will be conducted. Who will write the test
scripts for the unit testing, what would be sequence of events of System & Integration
Testing, and how will the testing activity take place?

4.3 Performance and Stress Testing.

Definition:
List what is your understanding of Stress Testing for your project.
Participants:
Who will be conducting Stress Testing on your project? List the individuals that will be
responsible for this activity. 
Methodology:
Describe how Performance & Stress testing will be conducted. Who will write the test
scripts for the testing, what would be sequence of events of Performance & Stress
Testing, and how will the testing activity take place?

4.4 User Acceptance Testing.

Definition:
The purpose of acceptance test is to confirm that the system is ready for operational use.
During acceptance test, end-users (customers) of the system compare the system to its
initial requirements.
Participants:
Who will be responsible for User Acceptance Testing? List the individuals' names and
responsibility.
Methodology:
Describe how the User Acceptance testing will be conducted. Who will write the test
scripts for the testing, what would be sequence of events of User Acceptance Testing, and
how will the testing activity take place?

4.5 Batch Testing.

4.6 Automated Regression Testing
Definition:
Regression testing is the selective retesting of a system or component to verify that
modifications have not caused unintended effects and that the system or component still
works as specified in the requirements.

Modems

6.0 ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS.

6.1 Main Frame.
Specify both the necessary and desired properties of the test environment. The 
specification should contain the physical characteristics of the facilities, including the
hardware, the communications and system software, the mode of usage (for example,
stand-alone), and any other software or supplies needed to support the test. Also specify
the level of security which must be provided for the test facility, system software, and
proprietary components such as software, data, and hardware.
Identify special test tools needed. Identify any other testing needs (for example,
publications or office space). Identify the source of all needs which are not currently
available to your group.

6.2 Workstation.

7.0 TEST SCHEDULE.
Include test milestones identified in the Software Project Schedule as well as all item
transmittal events.
Define any additional test milestones needed. Estimate the time required to do each
testing task. Specify the schedule for each testing task and test milestone. For each
testing resource (that is, facilities, tools, and staff), specify its periods of use.

8.0 CONTROL PROCEDURES
Problem Reporting
Document the procedures to follow when an incident is encountered during the testing
process. If a standard form is going to be used, attach a blank copy as an "Appendix" to
the Test Plan. In the event you are using an automated incident logging system, write
those procedures in this section.
Change Requests
Document the process of modifications to the software. Identify who will sign off on the
changes and what would be the criteria for including the changes to the current product.
If the changes will affect existing programs, these modules need to be identified.

9.0 FEATURES TO BE TESTED
Identify all software features and combinations of software features that will be tested.

going to be (for example, Mary Brown (User) compile Test Cases for Acceptance
Testing). Identify groups responsible for managing, designing, preparing, executing, and
resolving the test activities as well as related issues. Also identify groups responsible for
providing the test environment. These groups may include developers, testers, operations
staff, testing services, etc.

Identify the high-risk assumptions of the test plan. Specify contingency plans for each
(for example, delay in delivery of test items might require increased night shift
scheduling to meet the delivery date).
