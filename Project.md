 1.0 INTRODUCTION.
  This document will describe and track the testing of the game "Pixel Wizard" as layed out in the brief distributed to us by the games 
  creater and developer for the 2020 Software testing project. It will document every aspect of the testing process in necessary depth.
  The Game being tested is a 2D Castlevania-esque side scrolled with exploration elements in line with those of
  The Elder Scrolls : Skyrim,
  Salt and Sanctuary,
  Dark Souls.
  
 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND TASKS.
  The objective of this testing program is to ensure the game is of quality and meets all relevant standards in accordance to GSA   
  (Gaming Standards Association) protocols and other relevant standards : 
 
 A.G2S MESSAGE PROTOCOL V3.1
 
 B.S2S MESSAGE PROTOCOL V2.0
 
 C.GDS NOTE ACCEPTOR COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL V1.4

Functional UI and end-to-end testing on desktop, web, and mobile.
Cross-browser testing.
SAP, ERP, Delphi and legacy applications.
Run tests locally or remotely, in parallel or distribute on a Selenium Grid.
Robust reporting.
Ranorex integrates with leading solutions like Git, TFS, Jenkins, Bamboo, Bugzilla, SpecFlow, NeoLoad, TestRail and more for a complete testing toolchain.

TestCraft : A codeless Selenium test automation platform. The revolutionary AI technology and unique visual modeling allows for faster test creation and execution while eliminating test maintenance overhead. Testers create fully automated test scenarios without coding. Customers find bugs faster, release more frequently, integrate with CI/CD and improve overall quality of their digital products.
No programming skills required. Leverage manual testersâ€™ business knowledge and allow them to create automated test scenarios
Substantially reduce maintenance costs. Scripts are automatically adjusted to change due to our AI mechanism.
Selenium based. Quickly integrate and leverage modules developed by the community
Provides immediate time to value. Easy to master.

Bugzilla : A leading Bug Tracking tool widely used by many organizations for quite some time now. It is very simple to use, web-based interface. It is completely open sourced and is free to use.

3.0 SCOPE
General
This section describes what is being tested, such as all the functions of a specific product, its existing
interfaces, integration of all functions.
Tactics
List here how you will accomplish the items that you have listed in the "Scope" section. For
example, if you have mentioned that you will be testing the existing interfaces, what would be the
procedures you would follow to notify the key people to represent their respective areas, as well as
allotting time in their schedule for assisting you in accomplishing your activity?

4.0 TESTING STRATEGY
Describe the overall approach to testing. For each major group of features or feature combinations,
specify the approach which will ensure that these feature groups are adequately tested. Specify the
major activities, techniques, and tools which are used to test the designated groups of features.
The approach should be described in sufficient detail to permit identification of the major testing
tasks and estimation of the time required to do each one.

Methodology:

5.0 TEST SCHEDULE
Include test milestones identified in the Software Project Schedule as well as all item transmittal
events.
Define any additional test milestones needed. Estimate the time required to do each testing task.
Specify the schedule for each testing task and test milestone. For each testing resource (that is,
facilities, tools, and staff), specify its periods of use.

6.0 CONTROL PROCEDURES
Problem Reporting
Document the procedures to follow when an incident is encountered during the testing process. If a
standard form is going to be used, attach a blank copy as an "Appendix" to the Test Plan. In the
event you are using an automated incident logging system, write those procedures in this section.
Change Requests
Document the process of modifications to the software. Identify who will sign off on the changes
and what would be the criteria for including the changes to the current product. If the changes will
affect existing programs, these modules need to be identified.
